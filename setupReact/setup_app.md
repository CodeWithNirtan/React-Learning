If you have npx and Node.js installed, you can create a React application by using create-react-app.

step 1

=>npm create-react-app

note: If you've previously installed create-react-app globally, it is recommended that you uninstall the package to ensure npx always uses the latest version of create-react-app.

To uninstall, run this command:
=> npm uninstall -g create-react-app 

Create react app through npx
=>npx create-react-app appname

Run React application

=>npm start
